## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Achieving interaction without using JavaScript and using only CSS selectors.

Background image positioning offsets (background-position: 3 or 4-value setting) is bit of a tricky thing to understand. Instead of offseting from named vales (left, center, etc), use the equivalant numerical value for offsetting or use a calc().

Note: I attempted this without looking at existing solutions to see if I could figure it out myself.

### Continued development

Continue experimenting with background image properties.
